# My 100 Days of Data Science Practice

This repository tracks my daily journey learning Data Science, starting with the Titanic dataset.

| Day | Topic | Key Skills | Notebook |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 01 | Data Cleaning and plotting one graph | Handling basic pandas function | [Link](https://github.com/SamarthMathur-ai/Daily-Data-Science/blob/main/titanic_practice_1.ipynb) |
| 02 | Plotting Pie graph and Violin plot | Learning different graphs and their parameters | [Link](https://github.com/SamarthMathur-ai/Daily-Data-Science/blob/main/titanic_practice_2.ipynb)|
| 03 | Relation between age and survival rate & Combination of Sex, Class and Survival | Learning Facet Graph and details of pie graph and improved markdown also | [Link](https://github.com/SamarthMathur-ai/Daily-Data-Science/blob/main/titanic_practice_3.ipynb)

**Up until now I was making plots of already clear dataset of titanic**<br />
**From now I will work on the raw data of titanic**
* First I will clear the data
* Then I will plot it
* And then I will use the machine learning topics which I have learnt by then
  
| Day | Topic | Key Skills | Notebook |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 04 | Data Cleaning | Using of .loc function clearly | [Link](https://github.com/SamarthMathur-ai/Daily-Data-Science/blob/main/Basic_Titanic_1.ipynb) |
| 05 | Making Bachelors Section With the help of Mister etc. ,Making Fare Section, Plotting | Understanding .str extendor for using string functioin, Understanding qcut function and repractising the plotting function | [Link](https://github.com/SamarthMathur-ai/Daily-Data-Science/blob/main/Basic_Titanic_2.ipynb) |
| 06 | Finding relation between class and survived, class and fare | Understanding Box plot and revising count plot | [Link](https://github.com/SamarthMathur-ai/Daily-Data-Science/blob/main/Basic_Titanic_3.ipynb) |
| 07 | Finding relation between age and sex, age,familysize and survival | Point Plot, histplot in seaborn, and use of "axes" in pointing multiple plots at the same time | [Link](https://github.com/SamarthMathur-ai/Daily-Data-Science/blob/main/Basic_Titanic_4.ipynb) |
| 08 | Class/Age Survival and Class/Sex Survival and various correlations with the help of heat map | Understanding how to plot heatmap and understand it, when to select swarm or stripplot, and also how to plot bar plot | [Link](https://github.com/SamarthMathur-ai/Daily-Data-Science/blob/main/Basic_Titanic_5.ipynb) |


**For Now I will end this dataset cuz I am not sufficiently equipped with the right skills of machine learning for this dataset**<br />
* Hence I will start now with another dataset that is Real State Dataset in Kaggle [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
* Similarly as before I will clean the data and make plots.
* But unlike before this time the main focus will be on machine learning especially ***Linear Regression***.
